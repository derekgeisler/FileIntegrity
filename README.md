File Integrity Crypto Mining Process to prevent illegal copying and pasting

You might need the `hashlib` library for hash calculation and `subprocess` for starting the mining process.

Creating a system that initiates a cryptocurrency mining process based on detecting an improperly copied file is a complex task that should be approached with caution due to the ethical, legal, and security implications. However, I can provide you with a conceptual Python script that demonstrates how this might be done in a controlled and ethical manner, such as in a lab environment or as an educational tool.

Explanation:

File Hash Calculation (calculate_hash): This function calculates the SHA-256 hash of the file to ensure its integrity.

Original File Hash: You must pre-calculate and store the original file's hash. If the hash of the monitored file does not match this, the file has likely been altered or improperly copied.

Monitoring Function (monitor_file): This function continuously monitors the file. If it detects that the fileâ€™s hash has changed (indicating an improper copy/paste), it triggers the mining process.

Simulated Mining Process (start_mining_process): Instead of actually starting a mining process, this function just prints a message. You could replace this with actual mining software commands using subprocess.run.

Next Steps:

Replace the Simulated Mining Process: Integrate actual mining software in place of the simulation if you have explicit consent and are doing this in a secure, controlled environment.

Test in a Controlled Environment: Before deploying this script, thoroughly test it in a controlled environment to ensure it behaves as expected.

# FileIntegrity
File Integrity Crypto Mining Process to prevent illegal copying and pasting

You might need the `hashlib` library for hash calculation and `subprocess` for starting the mining process.

Creating a system that initiates a cryptocurrency mining process based on detecting an improperly copied file is a complex task that should be approached with caution due to the ethical, legal, and security implications. However, I can provide you with a conceptual Python script that demonstrates how this might be done in a controlled and ethical manner, such as in a lab environment or as an educational tool.
